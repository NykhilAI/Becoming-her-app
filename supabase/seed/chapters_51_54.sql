Scripture speaks within real narratives, letters, poems, wisdom sayings, and prophetic arguments. We 
should receive the text on its own terms before applying it to romantic decisions.
James locates sin not only in wrong action but in refusing known good; application requires humility about 
what is actually known.', 2),
  ('biblical_story', 'BIBLICAL STORY OR IMAGE', 'The passage gives us a picture of conscience, obedience, delay, and the cost of pretending not to know. It 
does not promise an easy life or a guaranteed relationship outcome. It shows what faithfulness looks like 
when a woman brings ordinary choices, desires, and relationships under God''s truth.', 3),
  ('teaching', 'TEACHING', 'A Christian woman preparing for marriage is not preparing for a performance. She is learning to live 
before God with honesty. The theme of this chapter - conscience, obedience, delay, and the cost of 
pretending not to know - matters because a covenant relationship will magnify whatever patterns are 
already being practiced in secret.
This does not mean you must become flawless before you are loved or before you marry. The gospel is not 
a reward system for polished people. It is grace that brings sin into the light, gives courage to repent, and 
forms a new way of living. Maturity is not the absence of weakness; it is increasing truthfulness, 
responsibility, teachability, and dependence on Christ.
Popular Christian relationship advice often turns a biblical idea into a formula: find the right sign, identify 
the right person, and secure the right outcome. Scripture is more durable than a formula. It teaches 
wisdom, patience, holiness, courage, counsel, and love. Those virtues help you discern reality whether 
marriage comes soon, later, differently than expected, or not at all.
So ask two questions. First, what is God asking me to examine in myself? Second, what should I learn to 
recognize in another person? Looking inward is not self-absorption; it is repentance and formation. 
Looking outward is not suspicion; it is responsible love. Both require the humility to let truth interrupt 
fantasy.', 4),

whether your interpretation is fair.
Do not use this chapter to diagnose someone else from a distance. Use it to slow down, ask better 
questions, observe patterns, and obey what Scripture actually says. Wisdom is usually quieter than 
urgency.', 5),

Give me courage to receive correction, patience to observe patterns, and humility to seek counsel. Protect me from 
fantasy that ignores facts and from fear that refuses every good gift.
Form in me the character of Jesus: truthful, holy, gentle, courageous, and willing to love without controlling the 
outcome. If marriage is part of my calling, let me enter it with wisdom. Whatever my future holds, keep me close to 
Christ. Amen.', 6),
