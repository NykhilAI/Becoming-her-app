  ('biblical_context', 'VERIFIED BIBLICAL CONTEXT', 'This lesson is grounded in Proverbs 15:22. The immediate passage and its larger biblical setting matter: 
Scripture speaks within real narratives, letters, poems, wisdom sayings, and prophetic arguments. We 
should receive the text on its own terms before applying it to romantic decisions.
Proverbs commends multiple counselors; wise counsel is not a license for gossip or outsourcing 
responsibility.', 2),
  ('biblical_story', 'BIBLICAL STORY OR IMAGE', 'The passage gives us a picture of community, counsel, confidentiality, and the limits of private certainty. It 
does not promise an easy life or a guaranteed relationship outcome. It shows what faithfulness looks like 
when a woman brings ordinary choices, desires, and relationships under God''s truth.', 3),
  ('teaching', 'TEACHING', 'A Christian woman preparing for marriage is not preparing for a performance. She is learning to live 
before God with honesty. The theme of this chapter - community, counsel, confidentiality, and the limits of 
private certainty - matters because a covenant relationship will magnify whatever patterns are already 
being practiced in secret.
This does not mean you must become flawless before you are loved or before you marry. The gospel is not 
a reward system for polished people. It is grace that brings sin into the light, gives courage to repent, and 
forms a new way of living. Maturity is not the absence of weakness; it is increasing truthfulness, 
responsibility, teachability, and dependence on Christ.
Popular Christian relationship advice often turns a biblical idea into a formula: find the right sign, identify 
the right person, and secure the right outcome. Scripture is more durable than a formula. It teaches 
wisdom, patience, holiness, courage, counsel, and love. Those virtues help you discern reality whether 
marriage comes soon, later, differently than expected, or not at all.
So ask two questions. First, what is God asking me to examine in myself? Second, what should I learn to 
recognize in another person? Looking inward is not self-absorption; it is repentance and formation. 
Looking outward is not suspicion; it is responsible love. Both require the humility to let truth interrupt 
fantasy.', 4),
  ('application', 'APPLICATION', 'Practice this lesson in one concrete place this week. Notice how community, counsel, confidentiality, and 
the limits of private certainty appears in your speech, schedule, friendships, family relationships, and 

decision-making. Write down evidence rather than impressions. Then ask a trusted, mature Christian 
whether your interpretation is fair.
Do not use this chapter to diagnose someone else from a distance. Use it to slow down, ask better 
questions, observe patterns, and obey what Scripture actually says. Wisdom is usually quieter than 
urgency.', 5),
  ('prayer', 'PRAYER — MAKE ME WISE AND WHOLE', 'Father, bring the truth of community, counsel, confidentiality, and the limits of private certainty into my real life. 
Show me where I am sincere, where I am afraid, and where I have been using spiritual language to avoid obedience.
Give me courage to receive correction, patience to observe patterns, and humility to seek counsel. Protect me from 
fantasy that ignores facts and from fear that refuses every good gift.
Form in me the character of Jesus: truthful, holy, gentle, courageous, and willing to love without controlling the 
outcome. If marriage is part of my calling, let me enter it with wisdom. Whatever my future holds, keep me close to 
Christ. Amen.', 6),
  ('truth_to_carry', 'TRUTH TO CARRY', 'I will let Scripture and observable fruit shape my wisdom about community, counsel, confidentiality, and the limits 
of private certainty, while trusting Christ with the outcome.', 7)
